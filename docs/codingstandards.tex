\begin{document}


\section*{Files and Classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each class should have a descriptive yet simple name in UpperCamelCase
  capitalization (e.g.  \texttt{InputParser}).
\item Likewise, each class should be declared in a header file with the same
  name and a .hpp extension (e.g., \texttt{InputParser.hpp}).
\end{itemize}


\section*{Method Naming and Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item We should use the C++ recommended naming convention which is
  lower\_\-case\_\-with\_\-underscores.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Variable Naming and Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Both class variables and local variables should follow the same naming
  convention as methods.
\item Unless absolutly necessary, class variables should be declared
  \texttt{private}.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Code Formatting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Indentations will be \textbf{4 spaces} each.  Tabs will be converted to
  spaces.
\item The first curly brace will go on the same line as the statement it's
  linked to.
\item Each line (either code or comment) should be kept at or under 80
  characters in length, with newlines inserted as necessary to break down longer
  lines.
\item Algorithms and design decisions should be commented if they're not
  absolutely clear
\item The fundamental structure or layout of other people's code should not be
  modified without a group meeting where everyone agrees that the modification
  is an advantage. If a group member wishes to restructure existing code, this
  work MUST be done on a separate branch.
\item Branch-to-trunk merges will happen with group members that touched code on
  the branch \textit{physically present} so they can help resolve merge conflicts.
\end{itemize}
