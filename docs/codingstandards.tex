\section*{Coding Guidelines/Standards}
Our coding guidelines consist of the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Indentations will be \textbf{4 spaces} each.  Tabs will be converted to
  spaces.
\item The first curly brace will go on the same line as the statement it's
  linked to.
\item Code must fit into the surrounding code nicely.
\item Local variables and functions will be named with lower case letters and
  underscores delimiting words. (e.g. \texttt{num\_elements})
\item Class members will be prefaced with an ``\texttt{m\_}''.
\item Class names will be upper case with no delimiters between words.
  (e.g. \texttt{Compile\-Controller})
\item Algorithms and design decisions should be commented if they're not
  absolutely clear
\item The fundamental structure or layout of other people's code should not be
  modified without a group meeting where everyone agrees that the modification
  is an advantage. If a group member wishes to restructure existing code, this
  work MUST be done on a separate branch.
\item Branch-to-trunk merges will happen with group members that touched code on
  the branch \textit{physicall present} so they can help resolve merge conflicts.
\end{itemize}
