BitTorrent-Reconstituter is the work of Charlie Moore, Aaron Lovato, and Thomas Coppi for
the CS 489 Network Forensics class.

===--------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Requirements
------------
A POSIX compatible system is required, as well as the boost, pcap, and OpenSSL
libraries. We have tested on Linux and Mac OS X.

Compilation
-----------
Simply run `make` in the top-level directory, and an executable named
"btfinder" will be created.

Usage: ./btfinder [options] <input files>
  The input files can be any number of pcap files and possibly the accompanying
  torrent files.  If torrent files are specified they are attempted to be
  matched with one of the pcap files if possible for verification.

Options:
  --output-file[=]<filename>, -o <filename>
    This option changes where the output will go.  By default, useful output is
    written to stdout and errors are written to stderr.  The '=' in the long
    form is optional.

  --help
    Show a help message describing these options
