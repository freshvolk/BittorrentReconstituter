BitTorrent-Reconstituter is the work of Charlie Moore, Aaron Lovato, and Thomas Coppi for
the CS 489 Network Forensics class.

===--------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Requirements
------------
A POSIX compatible system is required, as well as the boost, pcap, and OpenSSL
libraries. We have tested on Linux and Mac OS X.

Compilation
-----------
Simply run `make` in the top-level directory, and an executable named
"btfinder" will be created.

Usage: ./btfinder [options] <input files>
  The input files can be any number of pcap files and possibly the accompanying
  torrent files.  If torrent files are specified they are attempted to be
  matched with one of the pcap files if possible for verification.

Options:
  The '=' in the long form for any of these options is optional.

  --help
    Show a help message describing these options

  --interface[=]<iface>, -i <iface>
    Specify the interface you want to listen for live input.  Offline processing
    will not be done with this mode.

  --output-file[=]<filename>, -o <filename>
    This option changes where the output will go.  By default, useful output is
    written to stdout and errors are written to stderr.  

  --input-file[=]<filename>, -r <filename> 
    Specify filenames for offline processing.  Any non-pcap/torrent files will
    be ignored.  This option doesn't work if -i was specified as well.  Any
    extra arguments at the end will be added as an input file as well

===--------------------------------------------------------------------------===

To build the project for most configurations, run make with no targets.  The
following targets are available:
  tags: build vi style tags
  goodtags: build emacs style tags
  apidocs: generate doxygen autodocs
  clean: remove generated files
