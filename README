BitTorrent-Reconstituter is the work of Charlie Moore, Aaron Lovato, and Thomas
Coppi for the CS 489 Network Forensics class.

This program can be run on live input or a .pcap file.  It will parse out the
BitTorrent files that were transferred and reconstruct them.  If a torrent file
is specified, it will break the files up appropriately and give them the correct
filenames.  Otherwise it'll output one big file whose filename is the checksum
of its contents.  This big file will be all the other files concatenated
together.  They must be cut up manually if we don't have the torrent file,
because there is no way for us to know the file boundries without it.

Requirements
------------
A POSIX compatible system is required, as well as the boost, pcap, and OpenSSL
libraries. We have tested on Linux and Mac OS X.

Compilation
-----------
To build the project for most configurations, run make with no targets, which
will create an executable named "btfinder".  The following targets are
available:
  tags: build vi style tags
  goodtags: build emacs style tags
  apidocs: generate doxygen autodocs
  clean: remove generated files

Usage: ./btfinder [options] <input files>
  The input files can be any number of pcap files and possibly the accompanying
  torrent files.  If torrent files are specified, the program will attempt to
  match them with the pcap files for verification and file splitting.

Example usage:
./btfinder ./sample_pcaps/mippo.pcap ./sample_pcaps/mippo-creative_v92.mp3.torrent

Options:
  The '=' in the long form for any of these options is optional.

  --help
    Show a help message describing these options

  --interface[=]<iface>, -i <iface>
    Specify the interface you want to listen for live input.  Offline processing
    will not be done with this mode.

  --output-file[=]<filename>, -o <filename>
    This option changes where the output will go.  By default, useful output is
    written to stdout and errors are written to stderr.

  --input-file[=]<filename>, -r <filename>
    Specify filenames for offline processing.  Any non-pcap/torrent files will
    be ignored.  This option doesn't work if -i was specified as well.  Any
    extra arguments at the end will be added as an input file as well
